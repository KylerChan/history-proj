            The transformation of military strategy through technological revolution across four pivotal eras of the 20th century. From industrial warfare to digital precision, technology has fundamentally rewired the nature of strategic thinking.

        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The early twentieth century marked a turning point in the relationship between technology and warfare. The industrial revolution had already produced new weapons and logistical systems, but the First World War demonstrated their full strategic implications. Machine guns, rapid-fire artillery, and barbed wire rendered nineteenth-century manoeuvre tactics obsolete, forcing armies into entrenched positions. The telegraph and field telephone allowed commanders to coordinate vast fronts, transforming warfare into an exercise of endurance and supply rather than movement.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The railway network played an equally critical strategic role. National mobilisation plans such as Germany's Schlieffen Plan were timed to the minute according to train schedules, revealing how industrial infrastructure dictated operational possibilities. A more subtle but transformative invention was the French Renault FT-17 tank, the first armoured vehicle with a fully rotating turret. This innovation redefined armoured warfare by enabling independent manoeuvre and offensive mobility, ideas that would later shape interwar and Second World War doctrines. The First World War thus demonstrated that industrial and communications technology could dictate not only tactics but the entire strategic character of conflict.

        <!-- Era 2: Mechanisation -->

        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Between the world wars, advances in mechanisation and communications drove a new synthesis of speed, coordination, and information. Germany's Blitzkrieg campaigns epitomised this change. The effective use of tanks, aircraft, and — crucially — radios allowed units to communicate and adapt in real time, executing fast, decisive strikes that bypassed traditional static defence. Technology did not merely enhance the German military's mobility; it provided a framework for operational doctrine based on tempo and synchronisation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Equally transformative was the emergence of information as a strategic asset. The British development of radar, particularly the Chain Home network, gave the Royal Air Force a decisive edge during the Battle of Britain (1940). For the first time, air defence was guided by electronic detection rather than visual spotting, allowing limited resources to be deployed with precision. Simultaneously, advances in computing and cryptography created an entirely new battlefield: the domain of intelligence. At Bletchley Park, the invention of the Bombe and later the Colossus machines enabled Allied codebreakers to decipher German communications, directly influencing the timing and success of operations such as the Battle of the Atlantic and D-Day. A lesser-known but pivotal innovation was the cavity magnetron, developed at the University of Birmingham, which miniaturised radar systems to fit aircraft — a development that proved decisive in air superiority and anti-submarine warfare. By 1945, mastery of information and technology had become synonymous with strategic dominance.

        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The post-war period transformed military strategy from one of direct confrontation to one of deterrence and control. The development of nuclear weapons altered the very logic of strategy, making destruction so absolute that preventing war became the ultimate goal. Doctrines such as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) exemplified the era's paradox — stability through the threat of annihilation. Technology became the instrument of global balance, with both superpowers investing heavily in delivery systems such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched weapons.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Cold War also saw the integration of computing and aerospace technologies into strategic thinking. The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system in the United States, operational from the late 1950s, linked radar sites, computers, and interceptor aircraft in a continent-wide air defence network. This system not only automated response to potential nuclear threats but also pioneered real-time digital networking — an early precursor to the internet. Space technology further redefined strategy through reconnaissance and surveillance. Programmes such as CORONA, the first American photographic spy satellite project, enabled unprecedented global intelligence-gathering, reducing the uncertainty that had historically driven arms races. Institutions like the RAND Corporation used emerging computer technology to simulate nuclear scenarios and game out strategic options, turning warfare into a field of predictive modelling. The Cold War thus elevated technology from a support tool to the foundation of strategic logic itself.

        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            By the final decade of the twentieth century, the integration of digital technology and information systems had reshaped the conduct and planning of warfare. The Gulf War of 1991 is often described as the "first information war," highlighting the centrality of data, satellite communication, and precision-guided munitions. Coalition forces used Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to navigate the featureless desert, while real-time intelligence from reconnaissance satellites and surveillance aircraft allowed commanders to orchestrate operations with extraordinary precision.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Stealth technology, exemplified by the F-117 Nighthawk aircraft, introduced a new form of strategic advantage — the ability to strike without detection. Simultaneously, long-range precision weapons such as the Tomahawk cruise missile used TERCOM (Terrain Contour Matching) guidance systems to navigate autonomously across vast distances, transforming strategic bombing from area destruction to pinpoint targeting. The concept of network-centric warfare emerged, linking units across land, air, and sea through shared digital networks. Command and control, once limited by communication delays, became instantaneous. These developments marked a fundamental shift: victory increasingly depended on information superiority rather than numerical strength. By the end of the century, the general's map had evolved into a digital interface — a symbol of warfare's full integration into the information age.

            Throughout the twentieth century, technology progressively reshaped military strategy from the ground up. Industrialisation introduced mass production and logistical complexity; mechanisation and electronics brought speed and information; nuclear and computing technologies imposed deterrence and global surveillance; and the digital revolution closed the century with precision and networked warfare.

        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Each phase demonstrated the same underlying truth: strategy evolves not merely in response to human intention, but in dialogue with technological capability. As one analyst observed, the transformation was complete — from the general's physical map to the digital interface that symbolized warfare's full integration into the information age.
